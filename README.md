# School Work GitHub Repository

Welcome to my GitHub repository where I share all my code related to school work!

## Overview

This repository serves as a centralized location for storing and sharing the code I've developed for various school assignments, projects, and exercises. Whether it's programming assignments, data analysis projects, or any other code-related tasks, you'll find them all organized neatly within this repository.

## Why GitHub?

Using GitHub for managing my school work code offers several advantages:

1. **Version Control**: GitHub allows me to keep track of changes I make to my code over time. This ensures that I can easily revert to previous versions if needed and collaborate with others more efficiently.

2. **Accessibility**: By hosting my code on GitHub, I can access it from anywhere with an internet connection. It also allows for easy sharing with classmates, teachers, or anyone else interested in my work.

3. **Portfolio Building**: This repository also serves as a showcase of my coding skills and the projects I've worked on during my academic journey. It can be a valuable asset when applying for internships, jobs, or further education.

## Structure

The repository is organized into folders based on the courses or subjects I'm studying. Within each folder, you'll find subfolders or individual files corresponding to specific assignments, projects, or topics. I strive to maintain clear and descriptive naming conventions to make navigation easier.

*Please note:* Some and most of the content may be in Norwegian because it's my native language.

## How to Use

Feel free to explore the repository and check out the code I've written. If you're a fellow student, you might find it helpful for reference or inspiration for your own projects. If you're an instructor or researcher, please respect the academic integrity policies and avoid directly copying or plagiarizing any code.

If you have any questions, suggestions, or feedback, don't hesitate to reach out. I'm open to collaboration and constructive criticism.

Thank you for visiting!
